As there is one constant whenever you are making a code:  **CHANGE!!**_There will always be:_ - A new situation- New functionalities needed- A different approach for the problem- An update or upgrade in software- ….. and much much more change!  ### **The first design principle**Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. This is not only applicable for JAVA code, but also for Python and even Power BI dashboards data or Power Apps design.
