# Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey 

Hi, 

My name is Renate van Kempen and in this repo, I'll put all codes and files from my JavaScript learning journey. 

This journey is new to help me understand both the front-end side (JavaScript) as well as the back-end side (Python) in DataScience.

Feel free to help me out if you see any improvements. 

You can reach me via [email](renate@baime.nl) or via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renatevankempen/)


Kind regards, 

Renate van Kempen
